# Lec 9 Creating React Projects Browser based vs Local Development

We did our first project here in browser

There will be snapshots available linked

Two options
* Local Setup
  * Create projects locally on your system
  * Software dependency installed on system
  * Use a locally installed code editor with any settings and extensions of your choice
  * (And recording videos is easier on the author)
* Browser-based Setup
  * Remote service using code sandbox
  * No software installed, no files created on your local system
  * Mostly pre-config code editor inside of your browser

Offer both options in the links lesson
