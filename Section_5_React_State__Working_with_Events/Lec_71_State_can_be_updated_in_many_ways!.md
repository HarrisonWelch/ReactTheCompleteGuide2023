# State can be updated in many ways!

It's very common that a component updates on user interaction but it's not required. You can update states for whatever reason you have. 

Later in this course we'll see Http requests that complete an then we want to update the data on the screen with that.

You could also update state because of a timer like `setTimeout()` when it expires.
