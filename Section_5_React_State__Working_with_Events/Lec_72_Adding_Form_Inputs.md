# Adding Form Inputs

Now that we have state and listeners we can keep working on the expense tracker.

We need some user input so we can have users add their own expenses.

Now we have to make a new component. Name it `New Expense`.

form in it's own component

Users enter
* Title
* Date
* Amount

Self-closing tags is a React norm.

We want to add component
* Gather user input or on value change
* When submitted we gather the values and build a new expense object.

Looks like this:
