# Manipulating the DOM - Not With React!

**_Not_** going to see a reach out to DOM in js.

Being able to reach out to the webpage is a cool aspect of JS, but not with React because we want React to do it for us.

## Example of what we **_won't_** do

```js
const list = document.querySelector("ul");
list.remove();
```
