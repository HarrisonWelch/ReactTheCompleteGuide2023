# React Code Is Written In A "Declarative Way"!

How is a Component Build?
* HTML, CSS, and JS

React combines in all these components. Then we combine all these components to build a good UI

React allows you to create re-usable and re-active components consisting of HTML and JS (and CSS)

React use a Declarative approach

You won't tell React an HTML component should "be this" and "go there"

Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions.

## End the end:

Build our own, custom HTML Elements
