# A First Summary

Build interfaces by building and combining components
* React Cord Syntax & JSX
* Working with Components
  * Children

Inspect element will show you there is no Card or ExpenseItem component. You just see the elements as HTML CSS and JS

3 Concepts left to cover
* JSX
* How to organize the file
