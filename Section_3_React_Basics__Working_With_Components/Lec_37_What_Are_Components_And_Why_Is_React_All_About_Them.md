# What Are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?

React is a JS library for building user interfaces

HTML & CSS & JS are about building user interfaces as well

React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler
* Less error prone
* Focus on the business logic

React embraces Components, all about it.

What is a component?
* Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components.

Look a the web application (expense tracker)
* Expenses at the bottom
* 2 copies, data is different but repeated
* The month chart in the middle is just a bar repeated

Components are all just:
* HTML code
* CSS code for styling
* JS for some logic

Don't have to re-use a component, just a trait that it is re-usable.

The add-expense at the top is a component.

Date component in the list component.

Can split it up in a very granular way.

You build these components and then tell React how to construct them.

Why Components?
* Reusable
  * Don't Repeat yourself
* Separation of Concerts
  * Keeping code base small and manageable
  * Every component has one clear purpose

Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions

Mix and match as we need to.
