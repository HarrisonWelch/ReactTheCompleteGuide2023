# React - The Complete Guide 2023

Repository for holding notes over the Udemy class "React - The Complete Guide 2023". My hope is that another aspiring developer learning react via this Udemy class sees these notes and uses them as side-by-side supplimental code/notes or uses it to double-check the lesson material or maybe just a quick refresher days/months/years later.
