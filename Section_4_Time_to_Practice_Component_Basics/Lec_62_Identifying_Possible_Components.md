# Identifying Possible Components

At least 2 components
* Header
* KeyConcept

Could also build a third component for Concepts but that is optional

For a simple Website this would work but we want to practice the React component concept.

Example would be to delete the paragraph. Currently we would need to delete this 3 times and that is unnecessary repition so we embrace the components life.
