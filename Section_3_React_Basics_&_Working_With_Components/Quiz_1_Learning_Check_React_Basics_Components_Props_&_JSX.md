# Quiz 1: Learning Check: React Basics, Components, Props & JSX


## Question 1:
Which kind of code do you write when using React.js?

### Answer:
Declarative JavaScript Code

## Question 2:
What is "JSX"?

### Answer:
It's a special, non-standard syntax which is enabled in React projects

## Question 3:
Why is React all about "Components"?

### Answer:
Every UI in the end up is made up of multiple building blocks (= components), hence it makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combinations of components"

## Question 4:
What does "declarative" mean?

### Answer:
You define the desired outcome (e.g. a target UI) and let the library (React) figure out the steps.

## Question 5:
What is a "React Component"?

It's a JavaScript function which typically returns HTML (JSX) code that should be displayed.

## Question 6:
How many custom React components must a React app have?

### Answer:
That's totally up to you

## Question 7:
Which statement is correct?

### Answer:
With React, you build a component tree with one root component that's mounted into a DOM node.

## Question 8
What does "component tree" mean?

### Answer:
It means that you have a root node which then has more components nested beneath it.

## Question 9:
How do you pass data between components?

### Answer:
Via "custom HTML attributes" (better known as "props")

## Question 10:
How can you output dynamic data in React components (i.e. in the returned JSX code)?

### Answer:
You can use single curly braces (opening & closing) with any JS expression between them.
